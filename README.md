# Tip Time Composed

A hello world style app which lets you calculate tips.

This is the third app of the [Android Basics with Compose] course from Google, see [Unit 2] [Pathway 3] and the [Intro to state in Compose] Codelab.

(it basically is the 'composed' cousin of the Tip Time app from Google's Android Basics with Kotlin Course)
